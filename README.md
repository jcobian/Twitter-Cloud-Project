Twitter-Cloud-Project
=====================
Cloud Computing Project analyzing twitter data
Created by Jonathan Cobian and Maribeth Rauh
Fall 2014, University of Notre Dame

Now named "TwitterViz"

The point of this project is to analyze twitter data sets about popular events (in this case the Crimea Unrest) and create a front end so that users can analyze hashtags, keywords, and links and how their popularity changes over time (and possibly how it spreads by location over time)

The project uses AWS Elastic Map Reduce to run computations on the data set and Flask as our lightweight webserver for our front end.
